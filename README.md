### Objective 

Build a simple React or Next.js application that allows users to increment/decrement a counter, add values to a list, and sort the list in ascending or descending order. 

### Functional Requirements 

1. Counter Functionality 

- Display a number initialized to 0 

- Include a “+” button to increment the number 

- Include a “-“ button to decrement the number (but not below 0) 

- Include an Add button that adds the current number to a list only if it's greater than 0 

- Include an Add button that resets the counter to 0 after adding 

2. List Display 

- Show all added numbers in a list below the counter 

- Prevent duplicates (optional) 

3. Sorting Feature 

- Include a Sort button with toggle functionality: 

- Clicking it switches between ascending and descending order 

- The list should update accordingly
